If you have git installed, run the following to clone just the CSV-files branch

`git clone -b CSV-files --single-branch https://github.com/durtal/rBloodstock.git rBloodstock-CSV-files`

If you don't have git (why not?), but the easiest way is to click the CSV file above, then "view Raw", and copy it to your clipboard before pasting in excel.
